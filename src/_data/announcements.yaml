    description: Thank you to all of our neighbors who came out for the annual PHNA
      picnic yesterday behind CoRadius! We were fortunate to have perfect
      weather, to go along with great food (Smoking Barrels BBQ), fun and live
      music. Thanks again to our sponsors, State Representative Nick Kimble, and
      Jason Flowers Homes. An additional shoutout to CoRadius Coworking, and
      Zoomies Pet Cafe for providing hot dogs!
