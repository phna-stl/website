      Set up in the Our Lady of Sorrows parking lot will start at 5 PM, with trick-or-treating starting at 6. As this is our first time hosting a trunk-or-treat, we cannot estimate how many children may visit; however, you will be responsible for purchasing your own candy. Stay tuned for more details!
