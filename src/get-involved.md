PHNA recognizes four standing committees to boost our profile in the community and connect neighbors. These committees exist to help the board of directors execute the mission of PHNA. The four committees are:

- Events & Engagement
- Health & Safety
- Marketing & Membership Relations
- Neighborhood Beautification

The **Events & Engagement Committee** is to engage Association membership in social gatherings to promote a vibrant, safe neighborhood and connections between Members.

The **Marketing & Membership Relations Committee** is to provide external and internal communication strategies for the Association, to promote the Association, and assist in the recruitment and retention of General and Business members. The chair of this committee is the Correspondence Secretary.

The **Health and Safety Committee** is to promote and engage in projects and activities that promote the safety of residents, businesses and visitors. This included coordinating awareness campaigns with nearby neighborhoods and non-profit organizations and communicating with our District 1 liaison to identify public safety trends or concerns in the neighborhood.

The **Neighborhood Beautification Committee** stands to promote volunteerism in the neighborhood with the effect of cleaning and beautifying the neighborhood.
